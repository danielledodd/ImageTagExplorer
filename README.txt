Summary:
My overall approach for this assignment was to first get all of the adapters up and showing the views without using the database. Once I was sure that my adapters were correctly working, I added in the necessary methods inside of the ImageTagDataBaseHelper in order to be able to retrieve information from the database. One inefficient thing that my code does is that every time something is added to the SQL database, the entire database is then copied onto the ArrayList inside the adapters. Overall, this assignment took a long time and it was difficult to learn SQL. However, I feel like I learned a lot more about adapters and databases.
